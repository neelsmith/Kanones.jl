# Kanones

> â˜› Build customized morphological parsers for ancient Greek


- all data managed in delimited-text tables you can modify or add to with any text editor
- rigorously defined orthography.  Example parsers include standard orthography of printed editions of literary Greek, and a parser for epigraphic Greek in the alphabet used by Athens before 403 BCE.
- implemented entirely in the Julia language (no other technical prerequisites): 
    - platform independent
    - *fast*
    - code library can be used from command line, in scripts, in web apps, directly in an editor like Visual Studio Code
