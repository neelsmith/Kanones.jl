# Reference: Inflectional types and paradigms


For each inflectional type:

- an example of an entry in a table of stems
- an automatically composed paradigm illustrating the forms generated from that stem record

!!! note "Coverage"

    This section of the documentation is ultimately intended to include an example for every inflectional class in the datasets included in the Kanones github repository.
