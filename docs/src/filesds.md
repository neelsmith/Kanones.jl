# The `FilesDataset`

- dataset is an abstraction. Future versions of Kanones may have multiple concrete types. 
- right now, the only concrete type is the `FilesDataset`

Files dataset:

- specified directory layout
- delimited text files: no restrictions on naming, number of files, inclusion of blank lines for legibility


Subsequent pages detail working with files in a `FilesDataset`.
