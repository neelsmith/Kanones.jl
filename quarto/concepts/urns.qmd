Use of URNs for all concepts.

Implementation uses `AbbreviatedUrn`s from `CitableParserBuilder`: registry allows expansion/abbreviation.

Most significantly: lexemes and forms.  Lexeme URNs coordinated with widely used LSJ. (Also `lsjx` collection).

Forms can be manipulated without resorting to string manipulation while instantiation from strings is easy, too.
