## Prebuilt parsers you can use

A prebuilt parser for texts in standard literary Greek orthography is regularly available for download from `shot.holycross.edu`.


- `http://shot.holycross.edu/morphology/comprehensive-current.csv` is a prebuilt parser that includes vocabulary automatically culled from the digital Liddell-Scott lexicon published by the Perseus project.  The vocabulary entries have not been manually verified.

In 2024, this parser is not yet automatically rebuilt on a regular time table.

Load it and use it to parse texts the same way you would if you compiled your own parser.
