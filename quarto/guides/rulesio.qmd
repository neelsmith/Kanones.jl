# Saving and loading sets of rules

## Outline

### Motivation and concepts

In addition to managing inflectional rules in a Kanones files dataset with separate forms of table for each rule type, you can serialize a set of rules to a single delimited text string, and can later instantiate a rule set from this source.

This is useful because frequently you might want to construct a corpus-specific set of stems, but could use a standard set of inflectional rules with it.

### How to do it

- build a `RuleSet` (from an array of varied subtypes of `Rule`s)

The `RuleSet` is a CITE-serializable type, so you can just use `cex` and `fromcex`.
