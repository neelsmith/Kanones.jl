title: "🤷‍♂️  Adding noun stems"
---


- Stems associate a string and an inflectional class with a lexeme, identified by URN value
- Some types of stem require further information that pertains to the stem (e.g., inherent gender or persistent accent pattern)




## Nouns


`NounStem`s have an `accentpersistence` member indicating the type of accent to apply.  

!!! note "Controlled vocabulary for accent patterns"
    In the current version of Kanones, `accentpersistence` is a string value.  It should probably be changed to a better type to control the possible vocabulary.

Recognized values are:

- recessive
- stemaccented
- obliqueaccented
- inflectionaccented (the default)


!!! note "TBA: `obliqueaccented` vs. `inflectionaccented`"
    
    Explain difference with examples

## Participles and infinitives

> Work like other substantives, just using the appropriate stem for the tense/voice.
