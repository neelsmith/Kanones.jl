- dataset is an abstraction. Future versions of Kanones may have multiple concrete types. 
- right now, the only concrete type is the `FilesDataset`

Files dataset:

- specified directory layout
- delimited text files: no restrictions on naming, number of files, inclusion of blank lines for legibility
- associated with a specific orthography

Subsequent pages detail working with files in a `FilesDataset`.

## Instantiating a dataset

- root directory
- orthography

(See previous pages on the diretory layout of stem and rule types in a `FilesDataset`.)

This is enough for the `stemsarray` and `rulesarray` functions to collect all stem and rule data from the file system of a `FilesDataset`.

## Stems and Rules

There are five stem types that are subtypes of `KanonesStemType`.

There are nine rules types that are subtypes of `KanonesRuleType`.

Each stem type implements the `readstemrow` function; each rule type implements `readrulerow`.  These functions read a single delimited-text line and construct a stem or row of their type.
