## Kanónes

> ☛ *Build customized morphological parsers for ancient Greek*


`Kanones.jl` is a Julia package for building Greek morphological parsers. It features:

- data managed in delimited-text tables that you can modify or add to with any text editor
- rigorously defined orthographies.  Example parsers implement a standard orthography of printed editions of literary Greek, and an orthography for epigraphic Greek in the alphabet used by Athens before 403 BCE.
- implemented entirely in the Julia language (no other technical prerequisites): 
    - platform independent
    - fast:  a parser built with Kanones on consumer-grade hardware can typically parse a token in 1-9 milliseconds.
    - code library can be used from command line, in scripts, in web apps, directly in an editor like Visual Studio Code
