properties, forms, analytical types



Morphological forms (next page) are defined by unique sets of the morphological properties (that is, subtypes of `GreekMorphologicalProperty`) listed here.

Kanones has nine types of morphological forms, that are relate to traditional ideas of "parts of speech."  Each type is a subtype of the `GreekMorphologicalForm` abstraction, and is characterized by a unique set of morphological properties (e.g., nouns are identified by gender, case and number). These properties in turn are subtypes of the `GreekMorphologicalProperty` abstraction (described in the following section).
