`Kanones.jl` :


- *not* a parser: a system for *building* parsers
- underlying data comes from delimited-text source:
   - easy to modify/expand   
- all data sets have an explicit orthography   
- all identification by URNs
   - lexeme
   - form
   - rule
   - stem 
-  analysis-by-synthesis algorithm



## Older intro

Kanones is a system for building morphological parsers from simple delimited-text tables defining vocabulary stems and inflectional rules. While Kanones allows you to build parsers following the orthography of your choosing (e.g., ancient Greek in the alphabet used by Athens prior to 403 BCE), the largest available digital corpora of ancient Greek more or less follow the practice of standard print editions of literary Greek. The Kanones repository includes an extensive (and growing) set of inflectional rules that provide a solid basis for parsing standard literary Greek. For stem tables, the [LSJMining](https://neelsmith.github.io/LSJMining.jl/) package is a Julia package that can extract morphological information Giuseppe Celano's Unicode Greek version of the Perseus project's digital [Liddell-Scott-Jones lexicon](https://github.com/gcelano/LSJ_GreekUnicode) (LSJ). Precomputed analyses for all possible forms created by combining the stems quarried from LSJ with Kanones' inflectional rules for literary Greek are available as a (large!) csv file from the Homer Multitext project here.

Inevitably, when you parse almost any corpus of a certain size, you encounter vocabulary that does not appear in LSJ (proper names, for example). It is straightforward to create a supplementary dataset of stems that can be combined with the precomputed analyses from Homer Multitext project to analyze your corpus comprehensively.
