# Identification with URNs


 - URNs used in four elements of analysis are `Cite2Urn`s
 - Kanones works with abbreviated form
 - expansion of abbreviated form to full URNs is managed throug a URN registry
 

## Managing a registry

- `urnregistry` folder of your dataset may have up to three subdirectories with names `lexemes`, `rules` and `stems`. (URN namespaces for morphological forms are fixed and not configurable.)


!!! note "Validating your dataset's configuration"

    See [this milestone in GH repo](https://github.com/neelsmith/Kanones.jl/milestone/14) to track progress on Kanones' support for validating the structure and referential integrity of your dataset.
